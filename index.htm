<h2>e) Risk Warnings</h2>
<p><strong>i)</strong> Users acknowledge and agree that no transaction through the Platform is free from the following risks, and the Platform cannot and does not have the obligation to be responsible for the following risks:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>i)</strong> Macroeconomic risks: Users may suffer losses due to abnormal price fluctuations arising from changes in the macroeconomic situation;</li>
    <li><strong>ii)</strong> Policy risks: changes in relevant laws, regulations, policies and rules may cause abnormal fluctuations in prices and other areas, as a result of which the Users may suffer losses;</li>
    <li><strong>iii)</strong> Default risks: Users may suffer losses due to the inability or unwillingness of the project owner to carry out or continue carrying out their project;</li>
    <li><strong>iv)</strong> Risks related to earnings: digital assets are not issued by any financial institution or platform, and the digital asset market is a brand new and unconfirmed market that may not generate actual increase in earnings;</li>
    <li><strong>v)</strong> Trading risks: digital assets are mainly used by speculators, and are used relatively less in retailing and commercial markets; the trading of digital assets involves an extremely high level of risk because trading of digital assets goes on uninterrupted throughout the day without any limits on the ups and downs, and therefore prices are subject to large fluctuations caused by traders and/or global government policies;</li>
    <li><strong>vi)</strong> Risks caused by force majeure factors;</li>
    <li><strong>vii)</strong> User's fault: any and all losses caused by the Users’ fault, including loss caused by wrong decision-making, improper operation, forgetting or revealing passwords, deciphering of passwords by others, third-party intrusion into computer systems used by the Users, and malicious or improper operation by a third party entrusted by the Users to serve as their agent.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>ii)</strong> Digital asset transactions are extremely risky and are therefore not suitable investments for most people. The Users know and understand that part or all of their investment in digital asset trading may be lost, so the Users should determine the amount of their investment or transactions based on the extent of losses they can afford. In addition to the risks indicated under this Agreement, there will also be risks that cannot be predicted. Therefore, the Users should carefully assess their financial situation and various risks before making any decision on investment in or transaction of digital assets. The Users shall bear any and all losses arising from their decision, and the Platform shall not bear any responsibility for Users' investment or trading decisions. In view of the risks arising from digital asset investment or transaction, if a User has any doubts as to such investment or transactions, the User should seek the assistance of professional consultants prior to transaction or investment.</p>

<p>Platform does not provide any guarantee or condition to any User and/or any transaction, whether express, implied or statutory. The Platform cannot and does not attempt to control the information released by Users or project owners. The Platform does not undertake any form of certification and authentication services for such information. The Platform cannot fully guarantee the authenticity, sufficiency, reliability, accuracy, integrity and validity of all content on the Platform, and does not need to bear any legal responsibilities arising therefrom. The Users should base their transaction on their own independent judgment and assume full responsibility for their own judgment.</p>

<p><strong>iv)</strong> The Platform does not make any express or implied guarantee for its Users to use the Platform services, including but not limited to the applicability, absence of errors or omissions, continuity, accuracy, reliability and suitability for a particular purpose. Furthermore, the Platform does not make any undertaking and guarantee in connection with the validity, accuracy, correctness, reliability, quality, stability, integrity and timeliness of the technologies and information involved in the services provided by the Platform.</p>

<p><strong>v)</strong> Whether to log into the Platform or use the services provided by the Platform is the personal decision of individual Users, who shall exclusively bear any and all risks and possible losses that may arise from such decision. The Platform does not make any express or implied guarantee in connection with the market, value and price of digital assets. The Users know and understand the instability of the digital asset market. The price and value of digital assets may fluctuate significantly or collapse at any time. Engaging in digital asset transaction is the free choice and decision by individual Users, who shall exclusively bear the risks and possible losses that may arise.</p>

<p><strong>vi)</strong> The above clauses do not reveal all the risks and market situations that the Users may be subject to when they engage in transactions through the Platform. Before making a decision relating to transaction, the Users should fully understand the relevant digital assets, adopt a cautious approach to decision-making based on their own transaction objectives, risk tolerance capacity and asset status, and assume all risks exclusively on their own.</p>

<p><strong>vii)</strong> Under any and all circumstances, the third party shall be responsible for the services that are provided by such third party and are involved in the Users’ use of the Platform services, and the Platform shall not bear such responsibility. Any loss or liability caused by factors attributable to a User shall be borne by such User exclusively and the Platform shall not be held liable in any manner whatsoever. Circumstances under which the Platform shall not be held liable include:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>i)</strong> Where any loss or liability is caused by the User's failure to operate in accordance with this Agreement or any rules published by the Platform from time to time;</li>
    <li><strong>ii)</strong> Where any loss or liability is caused by any uncertainty, ambiguity or incompleteness in the instruction information sent by the User to the Platform;</li>
    <li><strong>iii)</strong> Where any loss or liability is caused by insufficient balance of digital assets in the User's account;</li>
    <li><strong>iv)</strong> Where any losses or responsibilities is caused by any other factor attributable to the User.</li>
